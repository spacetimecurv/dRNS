# dRNS
This repository contains initial data sequences of 260 different differentially rotating neutron star models, that were created with a modified version of the RNS initial data solver (https://github.com/cgca/rns) implemented in BAM/Whisky.

An ideal gas equation of state was used for all models, as well as the KEH rotation-law. Consult /sequences to see all the resulting output .txt files and additional informations about the columns. Sequences can be read in with sequences.py.

Sequences are used in this paper: https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/hnhc-m4lw
